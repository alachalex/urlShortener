# final_url
 
This is a readme for my URL shortener. I initially struggled with this project as I had no prior experience with web development, however I continued reading more about servers and front end development until I felt prepared to begin. Unfortunately, my summer has been incredibly busy between virtual summer classes and my summer internship, yet despite this I have jumped at the opportunity to learn something new. If I had additional time, I would make the UX better, and work upon letting the user customize their shortened link code. I would also create an option for the conversion of a link into a QR code to use and spread. If I had dramatically more time, I may think of a way to monitize the service including denoting the times a shortened link was used, so that the creator of the shortened link may use this service to sponsor a website.
